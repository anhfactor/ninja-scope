Ninja API Forge is a developer-focused contest centered on API creation rather than application building.

Participants are invited to design and implement their own APIs, powered by Injective’s on-chain data and trading infrastructure. The contest encourages developers to think in terms of abstraction, interface design, and reusability, contributing new infrastructure layers to the Injective ecosystem.

What You Build
You will build one custom API service designed for other developers to consume.

Your API should expose useful data or functionality derived from Injective, through clean and well-defined endpoints.

Suggested API Directions
1. Data Aggregation APIs

Simplify or restructure Injective data into developer-friendly formats.

Examples:

Market or trading summaries

Orderbook depth snapshots

Trading activity feeds

Price history endpoints

2. Computation or Derived Data APIs

Provide processed or calculated results instead of raw data.

Examples:

Liquidity or volatility metrics

Market health indicators

Risk or exposure analysis

Custom market signals

3. Developer Utility APIs

Improve the overall developer experience.

Examples:

Unified or simplified query endpoints

Cached or normalized data APIs

Multi-market aggregation APIs

Lightweight indexing or helper services

4. Special Track: Identity-Aware APIs（N1NJ4 Track）

This track focuses on APIs that understand, verify, or leverage developer identity using N1NJ4 as a primitive.
